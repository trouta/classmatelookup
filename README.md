This is a two-part interface that accepts class input from a Google Form and then allows a user to query the assembled database to find similar results.

To begin, first fill out the following Google Form, submitting one entry per registered class: https://forms.gle/NpdA266kYSCgFi6g9

After submitting your classes, query the following Google Sheet by entering a single class. The database will then return results featuring all other registered users with a matching course: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_aAN1IWo856qG9IwDGE_AhdFtieN9FhxEYp9s11Ur-0/edit?usp=sharing
